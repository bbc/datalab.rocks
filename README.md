## Come and work with us!

BBC is embarking on an ambitious and exciting _Connected Data Strategy_ that will enable the reinvention and digital transformation of the BBC. Data will play an vital role in achieving this and we must invest in building a data capability with audience interests at its heart. Our products reach hundreds of millions of users around the world, with billions of page views and video plays each week.  

To make the most of the potential for our audiences we’re looking for great mobile app developers to help us to grow our team. Co-located with our Data Science and Voice UI teams, you will be collaborating on a new project that is at the forefront of data and machine learning, developing a brand new audience experience from the BBC.  

We are aiming high and have an open brief to define what works best for our audience, so we are looking for people who can help shape both the technical direction and the audience-facing product.  We want to stay lean and move quickly to build, test and learn as we go, so your contribution will make a difference from day one. We want everyone to feel responsible for our collective success.

We are looking for a range of skills so if you have a demonstrable experience and passion for mobile app development and are excited by the idea having a big impact on BBC audiences, then please get in touch.  If you can demonstrate knowledge of Video and Conversational UI, machine learning, GCP or personalisation this is a bonus, but not a requirement.

You’ll have the opportunity to engage with engineers working on other BBC apps and services, tapping into the wealth of knowledge and experience of an organisation already serving a vast global audience.  Learning is an important part of the role, and you’ll have access to BBC Academy training programmes, the opportunity to attend technology conferences, and use other resources to progress as an engineer.

We are looking for: _senior Android software engineers, senior iOS software engineers, Android software engineers, iOS engineers, lead architect (data management), lead engineer (machine learning), and a lead data scientist_ to build a diverse team.
